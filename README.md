# Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning - EXTENDED
 My effort to make a Tic Tac Toe game using various Machine Learning algorithms, online using DJango & P5.JS! (Pure Maddness)
 
The goal is to create the game in a way that's unbeatable, so it requires some processing in the back-end section which might make the game run slow on poor internet connections. (Will be fixed in near future)

### Algorithms/Mthods I'm planning to use:
- Random
- Predefined
- MiniMax
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- Reinforcement Learning (Machine Learning)
