# Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning - EXTENDED
 My effort to make a Tic Tac Toe game using various Machine Learning algorithms, online using DJango & P5.JS!
 
The goal is to create the game in a way that's unbeatable, so it requires some processing in the back-end section which might make the game run slow on poor internet connections. (Will be fixed in near future)

### Algorithms/Mthods I'm planning to use:
- Pure randomness
- MiniMax algorithm - [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/) & [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
- Decision Tree (Machine Learning) - [Kaggle UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/tictactoe-endgame-dataset-uci)
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- Reinforcement Learning (Machine Learning)
